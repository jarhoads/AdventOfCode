# My Solutions for Advent of Code 2023  
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023)  

My plan for this right now is to try to catch up (I started a little late).  
My solutions aren't exactly great but I'd like to come back to them and use different languages and C# features.  
I'll likely not finish this since I came down with a cold and stopped working on it for about a week.  
It's still fun so I'll keep doing some of them.  

## Day 1 Solution Added  
I added the solutions for this and didn't use a real test framework.  

## Day 2 Solution Added  
I added the solutions for this and used xunit for unit tests.

## Day 3 Solution Added  
I added the solutions for this and used xunit for unit tests.

## Day 4 Solution Added  
I added the solutions for this.
This one was a little harder for me.  
I ended up getting sick while I was working on it and didn't come back to it for a while.  
I wanted to use recursion for part 2, but I couldn't get it to work for some reason so I used my iterative solution.  
I think an elegant recursive solution probably exists. I just ran out of time and want to move to the next problem.
