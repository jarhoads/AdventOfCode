# My Solutions for Advent of Code 2023  
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023)  

My plan for this right now is to try to catch up (I started a little late).  
My solutions aren't exactly great but I'd like to come back to them and use different languages and C# features.

## Day 1 Solution Added  
I added the solutions for this and didn't use a real test framework.  

## Day 2 Solution Added  
I added the solutions for this and used xunit for unit tests.
